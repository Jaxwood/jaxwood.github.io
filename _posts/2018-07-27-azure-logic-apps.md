Using Docker, Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and app services in Azure you can setup websites with continuous integration and deployment.

## Dockerfile

The first step is to have a simple dockerfile. In this example I have chosen to use a create-react-appas it is not really important for this post what the app is.

My Dockerfile is setup like this:

```docker
FROM node:7.4.0
MAINTAINER Jacob Lorenzen

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install

COPY public public
COPY src src

RUN npm run build
WORKDIR /app/build

RUN npm install -g http-server

EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT http-server
```

The dockerfile runs `npm install` and afterward `npm run build` which produces a static index.html file which can be hosted in a docker container using `http-server` node module. To get to the server port `8080` is exposed.

## Visual Studio Team Services

The next step is to setup a build in VSTS. This can be done using the task for building and pushing a dockerfile.

You have to setup a connection to your Azure docker registry but that is straightforward and I have not chosen to show that here.

The build part is equal to running the following command on your dev machine:

`docker build -t name.azurecr.io/react-docker:latest .`

The next step is to push the image to the registry.

![registry](/assets/images/registry.png)

I make sure to tag the image with the `latest` tag.

_One thing to note is that you need to use the build host for linux to be able to run docker commands. This setting can be found under `General`_

In this trival example I didnâ€™t use the `release management` part of VSTS. It is also possible to create a connection to a Docker host from VSTS. Which would make more sense for `release` definitions.

Now that the image is pushed to registry in Azure we can use it for our site.

## App services

To setup a site in Azure we need to use Web App on Linux.

![appservice](/assets/images/appservice.png)

After selecting this option you need to specify where the image is located and how to run it:

![appservice linux](/assets/images/appservicelinux.png)

In the startup command I specify to run the image detached and map port `80` to the internal port `8080` in the docker host.

After a while the web app is up and running and you can browse the site.

## Conclusion

With the support for Docker in both VSTS and Azure you can quickly leverage this for web app hosting. This setup works fine for simpler web apps.
